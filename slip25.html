Q.1). Build a bot which provides all the information related to you in college 
Ans:- 
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify 
app = Flask(__name__) 
college_info = { 
"name": "Sample College", 
"location": "City, Country", 
"programs": ["Computer Science", "Business Administration", "Engineering"], 
"facilities": ["Library", "Gym", "Sports Fields"], 
} 
@app.route('/college_chatbot', methods=['POST']) 
def college_chatbot(): 
data = request.get_json() 
if 'query' in data: 
query = data['query'].lower() 
if 'name' in query: 
response = f"The college's name is {college_info['name']}." 
elif 'location' in query: 
response = f"The college is located in {college_info['location']}." 
elif 'programs' in query: 
response = f"The college offers programs in {', '.join(college_info['programs'])}." 
elif 'facilities' in query: 
response = f"The college provides facilities such as {', 
'.join(college_info['facilities'])}." 
else: 
response = "I'm sorry, I don't understand that query." 
return jsonify({"response": response}) 
return jsonify({'error': 'Query not provided'})

app.run(debug=True) 
Q.2) Write a Python program to solve 8-puzzle problem. 
Ans:- 
def print_chessboard(chessboard):  
for row in chessboard:  
print(" ".join(row))  
# Function to check if it's safe to place a queen at the given position  
def is_safe(chessboard, row, col, n):  
# Check row on the left side  
for i in range(col):  
if chessboard[row][i] == 'Q':  
return False  
# Check upper diagonal on the left side  
for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):  
if chessboard[i][j] == 'Q':  
return False  
# Check lower diagonal on the left side  
for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):  
if chessboard[i][j] == 'Q':  
return False  
return True  
# Recursive function to solve the Eight Queens problem  
def solve_eight_queens(chessboard, col, n):  
if col >= n:  
return True  # All queens are placed  
for i in range(n):  
if is_safe(chessboard, i, col, n):  
chessboard[i][col] = 'Q'  # Place a queen  
# Recur to place the rest of the queens  
if solve_eight_queens(chessboard, col + 1, n):  
return True  
# If placing a queen doesn't lead to a solution, backtrack  
chessboard[i][col] = '.'  
return False  # No solution exists  
# Main function to solve the Eight Queens problem  
def main():  
n = 8  # Size of the chessboard (8x8)  
chessboard = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]  
if solve_eight_queens(chessboard, 0, n):  
print("Solution to the Eight Queens Problem:")  
print_chessboard(chessboard)  
else:  
print("No solution found.")  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
main()
